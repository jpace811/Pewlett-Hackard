# Pewlett-Hackard
#### Overview:
The purpose of this project is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. The company is wanting to prepare for a "silver tsunami" as employees reach retirement age.

#### Results
First, we determined how many employees are eligible to retire by job tite. In total, PH has over 300k employees with 90,398 (30%) at retirement age. The counts by title are below:

Second, we determined which employees are able to participate in the mentorship program. In total, 1940 employees are at the required age, and the counts by title are below. An further analysis could provide insight to "Staff" vs "Senior Staff" and technical vs non-technical roles.
